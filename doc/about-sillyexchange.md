the silly exchange lets you buy silly shares!

silly shares may go up or down in price, the price changes around every 10 minutes!

trade responsibly!

the main market page contains the following details:
- the current price, in beans, of one silly share
- the current number of silly shares that you own
- the number of beans in your wallet
- a number input labelled "count" with two attached buttons, "BUY" and "SELL"

there are no fees! but there are limits:
- maximum of 200 shares bought or sold per request/action
- maximum of 600 requests per minute

if you're writing a bot, make sure to keep these limits in mind!
