# sillypost.net/about

sillypost is a silly social network thingy where the goal is to BE SILLY :3 :3 :3

no ads or algorithms, you can only see the last 10 posts someone has made, and you have to be friends with them to see their posts at all!

all users have to get an Invite Code before they can join, existing users can buy Invite Codes from the store using "beans" (the sillypost currency)

you can also buy ipods for 100 beans, they aren't real ipods and they don't do anything THEY INDICATE YOUR SOCIETAL STATUS (leaderboard) but they're silly! :3

sillypost is currently in beta, so expect things to break!
